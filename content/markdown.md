# GitHub-Flavored Markdown example

1. Code snippets in a list.
1. ```javascript
   javascript;
   ```

   ```python
   python
   ```

   ```c++
   c++
   ```

1. List item

```javascript
javascript;
```

```python
python
```

```c++
c++
```

Basic useful feature list:

* Ctrl+S / Cmd+S to save the file
* Ctrl+Shift+S / Cmd+Shift+S to choose to save as Markdown or HTML
* Drag and drop a file into here to load it
* File contents are saved in the URL so you can share files

I'm no good at writing sample / filler text, so go write something yourself.

Look, a list!

* foo
* bar
* baz

And here's some code! :+1:

```javascript
javascript;
```

```python
python
```

```c++
c++
```

This is [on GitHub](https://github.com/jbt/markdown-editor) so let me know if I've b0rked it somewhere.

```php
php
```

```go
go
```

Props to Mr. Doob and his [code editor](http://mrdoob.com/projects/code-editor/), from which
the inspiration to this, and some handy implementation hints, came.

### Stuff used to make this:

* [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) for Markdown parsing
* [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/) for the awesome syntax-highlighted editor
* [highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/) for syntax highlighting in output code blocks
* [js-deflate](https://github.com/dankogai/js-deflate) for gzipping of data to make it fit in URLs
